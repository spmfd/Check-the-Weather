# Check the Weather Website

## Description

The goal of this website was to gain further practice working with APIs, for this project we were specifically working with the OpenWeatherAPI. I was able to get some practice with this working on my group project, but as that was done as a group practicing individually has yielded better results in learning and retaining the information.

I was able to use javascript to input information directly into my HTML, access the API using JQUERY, used 3 different outside sources, 1 for styling (bootstrap), and two more for information (OpenWeatherAPI and moment.js). As we continue to learn we can lean on our resources more to make our websites not only look better but also providing additional features for our Users. 

My biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the local storage information to be interactable so the User may be able to search for previous cities at the click of a button. Luckily I was able to work with the tutor Sangeetha this past week who helped me a lot in getting them to work. I was on the right track however I needed to learn a couple of new things (or at least new to me) in order to get them to work.
